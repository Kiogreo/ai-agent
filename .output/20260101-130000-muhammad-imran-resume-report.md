## Executive Summary

Muhammad Imran, I need to be **brutally honest** with you: This resume will not get you interviews for 3D Modeller, Environment Artist, or Game Asset Artist positions at companies like Streamline Studios, Sleeping Kaiju, or Passion Republic. 

**The core problem:** Your resume focuses heavily on F&B and factory work, while your actual game design skills and 3D portfolio are barely visible. For creative roles, studios want to see your **art first**, not your kitchen experience.

---

## Strengths

✅ **Clean, readable layout** - The visual design is professional and easy to scan  
✅ **Relevant software listed** - Blender, Unreal Engine, Adobe Suite are industry-standard  
✅ **Portfolio link included** - Critical for creative roles (though not prominently placed)  
✅ **Currently pursuing relevant degree** - Bachelor in Creative Game Design shows commitment  
✅ **Diploma foundation** - Graphic Design background is valuable for game art  

---

## Critical Weaknesses

### 🚨 **MAJOR ISSUES**

#### 1. **Completely Misaligned Summary Section**
Your summary talks about F&B operations and factory production. **This is career suicide for a 3D artist role.**

**Current:**
> "Hardworking and responsible individual with experience in F&B operations and factory production..."

**What recruiters think:** *"Why is this person applying for a 3D artist role?"*

#### 2. **No Portfolio Showcase**
You have a portfolio link, but it's buried at the top with contact info. For creative roles, your **portfolio IS your resume**. Studios like Streamline need to see:
- 3D models (characters, props, environments)
- Polycount optimization
- Texturing work (PBR materials)
- Game engine integration (Unreal/Unity)

#### 3. **Missing Game Projects Section**
Where are your:
- University game projects?
- Personal 3D modeling work?
- Game jams participation?
- Collaborative team projects?

**Without this, you have ZERO proof you can do the job.**

#### 4. **Work Experience Completely Irrelevant**
- Sharp Corporation (Nintendo QC) - **13 months**
- Marry Brown (Kitchen) - **11 months**

**Total:** 2 years of non-creative work that tells recruiters nothing about your 3D skills.

#### 5. **Skills Section Lacks Depth**
Listing "3D Modelling" and "Blender" means nothing without context:
- What kind of models? (Hard surface? Organic? Stylized? Realistic?)
- Polycount ranges? (Low-poly for mobile? High-poly for AAA?)
- Pipeline knowledge? (High-to-low baking, UV mapping, PBR texturing?)

#### 6. **No Quantifiable Achievements**
- How many 3D models have you created?
- What was the largest project you contributed to?
- Any awards, exhibitions, or recognition?

#### 7. **Graduation Timeline Unclear**
"May 2022 - Present" - Are you graduating in 2026? This needs to be explicit.

## Detailed Recommendations

### 🎯 **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do These TODAY)**

#### **1. Rewrite Your Summary - Make It About ART**

**Replace with:**
```
Creative Game Design graduate specializing in 3D environment art and game asset creation. 
Proficient in Blender, Unreal Engine, and PBR texturing workflows. Experienced in creating 
optimized game-ready assets for real-time rendering. Strong foundation in graphic design 
with a passion for building immersive game worlds. Portfolio: [prominent link]
```

**Why this works:**
- Immediately positions you as a 3D artist
- Mentions technical skills (PBR, optimization)
- Shows specialization (environment art)
- Leads with portfolio

#### **2. Add a "GAME PROJECTS & 3D WORK" Section**

Place this **ABOVE** your F&B work experience. Format:

```
GAME PROJECTS & 3D PORTFOLIO

[Project Name] - Environment Artist                                    [Month Year]
[Brief description - 1 line about the game/project]
• Created [X number] of optimized 3D environment assets including [specific examples]
• Modeled and textured [specific asset types] using Blender and Substance Painter
• Implemented assets in Unreal Engine with LODs and collision meshes
• Maintained polycount budget of [X] tris for mobile/PC optimization
• Collaborated with [X] team members using [version control tool]
Portfolio: [Direct link to this project]

[Repeat for 2-3 strongest projects]
```

**If you don't have projects:** This is a **RED FLAG**. You MUST create portfolio pieces NOW.

#### **3. Restructure Your Entire Resume**

**New order:**
1. Header (Name, Contact, **PORTFOLIO LINK IN LARGE TEXT**)
2. Summary (Rewritten - see above)
3. **PORTFOLIO HIGHLIGHTS** (3-4 thumbnail images of best work)
4. Skills & Software (Expanded - see below)
5. **Game Projects & 3D Work** (NEW SECTION)
6. Education
7. Professional Experience (Minimized or removed)
8. Languages & References

#### **4. Expand Your Skills Section**

**Current:** Generic lists  
**Needed:** Specific technical competencies

```
3D MODELING & TEXTURING
• Hard-surface modeling (props, weapons, architecture)
• Organic modeling (characters, creatures, foliage)
• UV mapping and texture optimization
• PBR material creation (Albedo, Normal, Roughness, Metallic)
• Retopology and mesh optimization

GAME ENGINES
• Unreal Engine 5 (Blueprints, Nanite, Lumen)
• Asset importing and material setup
• Level design and environment composition

SOFTWARE PROFICIENCY
• Blender (Modeling, UV unwrapping, basic rigging)
• Adobe Photoshop (Texture painting, concept art)
• Adobe Illustrator (UI elements, vector assets)
• Substance Painter/Designer (if applicable)
• Version control: Git/Perforce (if applicable)
```

#### **5. Handle Your F&B/Factory Experience Strategically**

**Option A (Recommended):** Create a single condensed section

```
OTHER PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

Quality Control & Operations                                    Sep 2021 - Sep 2019
Sharp Corporation SDN BHD | Marry Brown Restaurant
• Developed attention to detail through quality inspection work
• Demonstrated reliability and time management in fast-paced environments
```

**Option B:** Remove entirely if you have enough project work to fill the page

**Why?** This experience doesn't help you get 3D artist jobs. Minimize or eliminate it.

## Industry Insights: Malaysian Multimedia Market

## Harsh Truth Section

Muhammad Imran, I'm going to tell you what other recruiters won't:

### **Why Your Resume Gets Rejected**

1. **It doesn't look like a 3D artist's resume** - It looks like someone from F&B trying to switch careers
2. **No visual proof** - Studios hire based on what you can DO, not what you say
3. **Experience tells wrong story** - 2 years in non-creative work signals lack of commitment to game art
4. **Skills are too vague** - "3D Modelling" could mean anything from architectural viz to medical modeling

### **What You're Competing Against**

Other fresh grads applying to the same roles have:
- 20-30 portfolio pieces on ArtStation
- Game jam participation (Global Game Jam, Ludum Dare)
- Internships at game studios (even unpaid)
- Active presence in game dev communities
- YouTube channels showing their process
- Contributions to open-source game projects

**Your current resume shows NONE of this.**

### **The Uncomfortable Question**

Do you actually want to be a 3D artist, or are you just applying because you have a game design degree?

**If you're serious:**
- You should be creating 3D art every day
- Your portfolio should be your obsession
- You should know the polycount of every asset in your favorite games
- You should follow environment artists on Twitter/Instagram
- You should be watching tutorials and breakdowns constantly

**If you're not doing these things,** studios will sense it immediately.

## Closing Advice

Muhammad Imran, I know this feedback is harsh. But I'm giving you the **truth** that will actually help you, not the polite lies that keep you unemployed.

**The good news:**
- You have the right educational background
- You have access to the right software
- The Malaysian game industry needs 3D artists
- You're young enough to pivot fully into this career

**The bad news:**
- Your current resume won't get you hired anywhere
- You need to treat portfolio building like a full-time job
- You're competing against people who've been building portfolios for years

**What separates successful fresh grads from unsuccessful ones:**
- Successful: Portfolio of 15+ pieces, active in community, applies to 50+ studios
- Unsuccessful: Generic resume, weak portfolio, applies to 5 studios then gives up

**Which one will you be?**

If you implement even 50% of these recommendations, you'll be ahead of most fresh grads. If you implement 100%, you'll start getting interviews within 3 months.

The choice is yours.
