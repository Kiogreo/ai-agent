## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. **WRONG CANDIDATE INFORMATION**
Your resume shows:
- **Name on resume:** Wan Nor Raihan Wan Ramli
- **Email on resume:** wanraihan.ramli@gmail.com
- **Phone on resume:** +6013-290 2216

But the file is titled "Muhammad Imran Resume.pdf" and your email signature is `imranworking13942@gmail.com`.

**This is a MAJOR RED FLAG that will get your resume immediately rejected.**

### 2. **MISSING CRITICAL CONTENT FOR GAME ART ROLES**
For 3D Modeller/Environment Artist/Game Asset Artist positions, your resume lacks:
- ❌ Portfolio showcase (only a Behance link with no context)
- ❌ 3D projects or game assets created
- ❌ Software proficiency levels (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- ❌ Any game development projects
- ❌ Relevant coursework or academic projects
- ❌ Technical skills breakdown (modeling, texturing, lighting, etc.)

### 3. **IRRELEVANT WORK EXPERIENCE**
- Marry Brown Kitchen Position (F&B) - **0% relevant**
- Sharp Corporation Production Line (Manufacturing) - **0% relevant**

These positions do NOT demonstrate any transferable skills for game art roles.

---

## Strengths

✅ **Educational Background:** Bachelor in Creative Game Design from UiTM is relevant  
✅ **Software Listed:** Blender, Unreal Engine, Adobe Suite mentioned  
✅ **Clean Visual Design:** Single-page layout is readable  
✅ **Contact Information:** Multiple contact methods provided  

---

## Areas for Improvement

### CRITICAL (Must Fix Immediately)
1. ❌ **Identity Mismatch** - Resume shows wrong person's information
2. ❌ **No Portfolio Content** - Just a link, no project descriptions
3. ❌ **Zero Game Art Projects** - No evidence of 3D modeling work
4. ❌ **Weak Skills Section** - No proficiency levels or specializations
5. ❌ **Irrelevant Experience** - F&B and manufacturing jobs don't support game art career

### HIGH PRIORITY
6. ❌ **Missing Keywords** - No industry-standard terms (PBR workflow, topology, UV mapping, etc.)
7. ❌ **No Achievements** - No quantifiable results or accomplishments
8. ❌ **Generic Summary** - Focuses on F&B/manufacturing, not game art
9. ❌ **No Academic Projects** - Missing university coursework showcase
10. ❌ **Poor ATS Optimization** - Lacks keywords for game art positions

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
11. ❌ **References Section** - Takes up space, should be "Available upon request"
12. ❌ **Language Section** - Not critical for technical art roles
13. ❌ **Vague Skills** - "3D Modelling" and "Game Designing" are too broad

## Detailed Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Next 24 Hours)

#### 1. **FIX THE IDENTITY ISSUE** 🚨
```
CURRENT: Wan Nor Raihan Wan Ramli
CORRECT: Muhammad Imran Bin Mohamed Idzham

CURRENT: wanraihan.ramli@gmail.com
CORRECT: imranworking13942@gmail.com (or create professional email: imran.idzham@gmail.com)
```

**WHY:** This single error will get you auto-rejected. Recruiters will think:
- You used someone else's resume template and forgot to change it
- You're careless with details
- You might be misrepresenting yourself

#### 2. **CREATE A PORTFOLIO SECTION (Replace References)**
```markdown
PORTFOLIO & PROJECTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎮 [Project Name] - Environment Art | Unreal Engine 5
• Created modular dungeon environment with 15+ game-ready assets

**WHY:** Game studios NEED to see your work. A link alone is not enough.

#### 3. **REWRITE YOUR SUMMARY FOR GAME ART**
```
CURRENT (WRONG):
"Hardworking and responsible individual with experience in F&B operations 
and factory production..."

REPLACE WITH:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Creative Game Design graduate specializing in 3D environment art and 
game asset creation. Proficient in Blender and Unreal Engine with hands-on 
experience creating optimized game-ready assets for real-time rendering.

1. ❌ Identity mismatch (auto-reject)
2. ❌ No portfolio content
3. ❌ Zero game art projects shown
4. ❌ Irrelevant work experience dominates

**Potential After Fixes:** 70-75/100 (GOOD)
- With proper portfolio section: +15 points
- With academic projects: +10 points
- With ATS optimization: +8 points

### Recommendation: DO NOT APPLY YET

**Why:** You will waste opportunities and damage your reputation by applying with this resume.

**Timeline:**
- **Minimum:** 2 weeks to fix critical issues
- **Ideal:** 1-2 months to build portfolio content
- **Best Case:** 3-6 months to create competitive portfolio

### Your Path Forward

**Option A: Fast Track (2-4 weeks)**
1. Fix identity errors immediately
2. Add 3-5 academic projects with descriptions
3. Create ATS-friendly version
4. Apply to small studios/internships
5. Build portfolio while job hunting

**Option B: Strategic Build (3-6 months)**
1. Fix resume issues
2. Create 5-10 new portfolio pieces
3. Participate in game jams
4. Build online presence (ArtStation, LinkedIn)
5. Apply to target studios (Streamline, Lemon Sky)
6. Higher success rate, better positions

**My Recommendation:** Option B

**Why:** The Malaysian game art market is competitive. Rushing with a weak portfolio will result in rejections that could have been avoided. Invest 3-6 months building a strong portfolio, and you'll have a 10x better chance of landing your dream role.

## Encouragement & Reality Check

### The Good News
✅ You have the RIGHT education (Creative Game Design from UiTM)  
✅ You know the RIGHT software (Blender, Unreal Engine)  
✅ You're targeting the RIGHT roles (specific, not generic)  
✅ You're seeking feedback BEFORE applying (smart move)  

### The Reality
⚠️ Your current resume will NOT get you interviews  
⚠️ Game art is 90% portfolio, 10% resume  
⚠️ Fresh grad competition is fierce in Malaysia  
⚠️ You need 3-6 months of focused portfolio work  

### The Path
🎯 Fix critical errors (1 week)  
🎯 Build portfolio content (2-3 months)  
🎯 Network and apply strategically (ongoing)  
🎯 Be prepared for rejections (normal for fresh grads)  
🎯 Keep learning and improving (career-long habit)  

---

**You have potential, but you need to put in the work. The Malaysian game industry is growing, and there ARE opportunities for talented fresh grads. But you must prove your skills through your portfolio, not just list software names on a resume.**

**Start with Week 1 tasks today. Fix the identity error within 24 hours. Then focus on building portfolio content for the next 2-3 months. When you're ready, come back for a second review.**

**Good luck, Muhammad Imran. You can do this, but only if you commit to the work.**
