## ❌ CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. **WRONG SUMMARY - FATAL ERROR** 🚨

**Current Summary:**
> "Hardworking and responsible individual with experience in F&B operations and factory production. Skilled in kitchen preparation, cleaning, restocking supplies, and maintaining a safe and organized workspace..."

**Problem:** This reads like a resume for:
- Restaurant manager
- Factory worker
- Warehouse supervisor

**NOT** a 3D artist for game studios.

**Impact:** Recruiters will spend 6 seconds scanning your resume. If the summary says "F&B and factory," they'll immediately reject you without reading further.

---

### 2. **NO PORTFOLIO CONTENT - DEAL BREAKER** 🚨

**Current:** Just a "Portfolio" link with no context

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ What projects are in your portfolio?
- ❌ What did you create?
- ❌ What tools did you use?
- ❌ What results did you achieve?

**Reality Check:**  
Game studios receive 50-100 applications per position. Recruiters will NOT click your link unless you give them a reason to. You need to **showcase** your best work ON the resume.

---

### 3. **VAGUE SKILLS SECTION - NO DEPTH**

**Current:**
```
3D Modelling
Game Designing
Unreal Engine
Blender
Adobe Illustrator
Adobe After Effect
Adobe Photoshop
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ No proficiency levels (Beginner? Intermediate? Expert?)
- ❌ Too broad ("3D Modelling" - what type? Characters? Environments? Props?)
- ❌ No specialization (What makes you unique?)
- ❌ Missing key technical terms (PBR, topology, UV mapping, etc.)

**ATS Impact:** Your resume lacks keywords that ATS systems scan for.

---

### 4. **IRRELEVANT WORK EXPERIENCE - WASTED SPACE**

**Current Experience:**
1. Sharp Corporation (Nintendo Switch Production Line)
2. Marry Brown (Kitchen Position)

**Relevance to 3D Artist Role:** 0%

**What Recruiters Think:**
- "Why is a kitchen worker applying for 3D artist?"
- "No game industry experience at all?"
- "Is this person serious about game art?"

**Better Use of Space:**
- Academic projects from your degree
- Game jams or competitions
- Personal 3D art projects
- Freelance work or commissions

---

### 5. **NO ACADEMIC PROJECTS - MISSING PROOF OF SKILLS**

You're currently studying **Bachelor of Creative Game Design** (May 2022 - Present).

**Expected by Recruiters:**
- Final year project (capstone)
- Coursework assignments (3D modeling, environment design)
- Group projects (game prototypes)
- Individual art pieces

**Current Resume:** Shows ZERO university work.

**Impact:** Recruiters will assume you either:
1. Haven't learned anything in 2+ years of study
2. Your work isn't good enough to show
3. You're not serious about the field

---

### 6. **MISSING INDUSTRY KEYWORDS (ATS FAILURE)**

**What ATS Systems Look For:**
- PBR workflow
- Topology optimization
- UV unwrapping
- Texture baking
- Game-ready assets
- LOD (Level of Detail)
- Polygon count optimization
- Real-time rendering
- Asset pipeline
- Version control (Git, Perforce)

**Your Resume:** Has NONE of these terms.

**Result:** Your resume will be auto-rejected by 70% of companies using ATS.

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### CRITICAL FIXES (Do This Weekend)

#### 1. **REWRITE SUMMARY - TOP PRIORITY** 🚨

**DELETE THIS:**
```
Hardworking and responsible individual with experience in F&B operations 
and factory production. Skilled in kitchen preparation, cleaning, restocking 
supplies, and maintaining a safe and organized workspace. Also experienced 
in production line work and quality control, ensuring products meet standards 
and daily targets. Able to follow instructions carefully and complete tasks 
efficiently. Prefer a focused working environment with clear guidance to 
deliver consistent and high-quality results.

```
3D Modelling
Game Designing
Unreal Engine
Blender
Adobe Illustrator
Adobe After Effect
Adobe Photoshop
```

**WITH:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
TECHNICAL SKILLS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

3D Modeling & Sculpting
• Blender (Intermediate) — Hard-surface & organic modeling, modifiers, UV unwrapping

---

#### 4. **HANDLE IRRELEVANT WORK EXPERIENCE**

You have 2 options:

**OPTION A: Remove Entirely** (RECOMMENDED)

Delete both work experiences and use that space for:

- Academic achievements
- Certifications or online courses
- Game jams or competitions

**Why:** For creative roles, portfolio > work experience. F&B and manufacturing add ZERO value.

---

**OPTION B: Minimize & Reframe**

If you must keep them (e.g., to show work ethic or explain employment gap):

```
ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Sharp Corporation SDN BHD | Quality Inspector        Sep 2021 - Oct 2022

**CURRENT:**
```
REFERENCES

Wan Nor Raihan Wan Ramli

- Only 5-10% get interviews
- Only 1-2% get hired

**What Gets You Noticed:**
1. Exceptional portfolio (top 10% quality)

3. Game jam participation (shows passion)
4. Internship experience (even unpaid)
5. Active online presence (ArtStation, LinkedIn)

### 4. **You Need 3-6 Months Before Applying to Dream Studios**

**Streamline/Lemon Sky Timeline:**
- Today: Not ready (portfolio not shown, skills too basic)
- 3 months: Possible (with intensive portfolio building)
- 6 months: Competitive (with 5-10 strong pieces)
- 12 months: Strong candidate (with internship experience)

**Indie Studios Timeline:**
- Today: Possible (after resume fixes)
- 1 month: Competitive (with portfolio section added)
- 3 months: Strong candidate (with new portfolio pieces)

**My Recommendation:**
- Apply to indie studios/internships NOW (after resume fixes)
- Build portfolio for 3-6 months
- Apply to dream studios (Streamline, Lemon Sky) in 6-12 months

### 5. **First Job Will Be Low-Paying**

**Reality Check:**
- Expected starting salary: RM 2,000 - RM 3,000
- Internships: RM 1,000 - RM 1,500 (or unpaid)
- May need to relocate to KL (housing costs)
- Competition drives salaries down for fresh grads

**Strategy:**
- Accept lower salary for first role (experience > money)
- Negotiate after 6-12 months with proven results
- Build portfolio on the job
- Switch companies after 1-2 years for better pay

**Long-Term Outlook:**
- Year 1: RM 2,500 (Junior Artist)
- Year 2-3: RM 3,500 - RM 4,500 (Artist)
- Year 4-5: RM 5,000 - RM 7,000 (Senior Artist)
- Year 6+: RM 8,000+ (Lead Artist / Specialist)
