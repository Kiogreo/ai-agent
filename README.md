# Kiogreo AI Agent

## Tech Stack

- opencode (open source AI coding agent)
- other coding agents such as Claude Code

## Example Workflow

1. I ask an agent to process an online documentation page & produce a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Markdown document.

## Important Folder Structure

| Folder | Remarks |
| --- | --- |
| `.output` | temporary folder for any output created by an Ai agent for other AI agent or even the user to consume |
| `test` | Stores the output of documents that need further screening process (it can be a prototype of ai agent, prototype of technical documentation & etc) |
| `library` | Stores all the permanent documents that is meant to be the main archives (hence the name 'library') |

## About This Project

### Why is this repo created?

Nowadays, I find myself being left behind when it comes to R&D or any research related stuff.

So, I created this repo as a means for me to consolidate all my R&D notes & also as a means for me to understand AI better & how to use them in broader context (other than coding).

### What is the Project MVP?

1. To have a centralized library of AI subagent for me to choose for any kind of purpose (especially for research).
2. To have a centralized research documentation involving many broad topics.
3. To have a autonomous system where I can make use of the AI agents/subagent to help me improve my reaserching skills. An AI may help me in terms of processing documents to produce a RAG based documents that'll be fed to another AI agent to help me with a more technical tasks.

### How are we going to archive the MVP?

1. I'll store all the agent/subagent files into this repo so that I can pull them whereever I am as long as I have internet & access to this remote git repo.
2. I'll store each of the output files from the AI agents into this repo & decided which one to keep & which will not. Generally, they are collected within those folders:

| Directory | Remark |
| --- | --- |
| `.output` | Temporary directory to store output of an AI agent (it can be a medium for other AI agent to based on for their work) |
| `.lab` | Semi-temporary directory to store any research output for further steps |
| `.library` | The actual folder that stores all of my reseaches (hence it's called library) |
