# Kiogreo AI Agent

## Tech Stack

- opencode (open source AI coding agent)
- other coding agents such as Claude Code

## Example Workflow

1. I ask an agent to process an online documentation page & produce a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Markdown document.

## Important Folder Structure

| Folder | Remarks |
| --- | --- |
| `.output` | temporary folder for any output created by an Ai agent for other AI agent or even the user to consume |
| `test` | Stores the output of documents that need further screening process (it can be a prototype of ai agent, prototype of technical documentation & etc) |
| `library` | Stores all the permanent documents that is meant to be the main archives (hence the name 'library') |

## About This Project

### Why is this repo created?

Nowadays, I find myself being left behind when it comes to R&D or any research related stuff.

So, I created this repo as a means for me to consolidate all my R&D notes & also as a means for me to understand AI better & how to use them in broader context (other than coding).

### What is our MVP?

1. To have a centralized library of AI subagent for me to choose for any kind of purpose (especially for research).
2. To have a centralized research documentation involving many broad topics.
3. To have a autonomous system where I can make use of the AI agents/subagent to help me improve my reaserching skills. An AI may help me in terms of processing documents to produce a RAG based documents that'll be fed to another AI agent to help me with a more technical tasks.

### How are we going to archive the MVP?

1. Create multiple AI agents that are good at only a single specific task
2. Create a workflow using the many AI agents to produce a single good quality output (it can be in a form of another AI agent or research documents).
