# Kiogreo AI Agent

## About

### Why is this repo created?

Nowadays, I find myself being left behind when it comes to R&D or any research related stuff.

So, I created this repo as a means for me to consolidate all my R&D notes & also as a means for me to understand AI better & how to use them in broader context (other than coding).

### What is our MVP?

1. To have a centralized library of AI subagent for me to choose for any kind of purpose.
2. To have a centralized research documentation (which will be stored under Markdown format) for any kind of purpose.
3. To have a version control system for each of the documentations.

### How are we going to archive the MVP?

1. I'll store all the agent/subagent prompt into this repo so that I can pull them whereever I am as long as I have internet & access to this remote git repo.
2. I'll store each of the output files from the AI agents into this repo & decided which one to keep & which will not. Generally, they are collected within those folders:

| Directory | Remark |
| --- | --- |
| `.output` | Temporary directory to store output of an AI agent (it can be a medium for other AI agent to based on for their work) |
| `.lab` | Semi-temporary directory to store any research output for further steps |
| `.library` | The actual folder that stores all of my reseaches (hence it's called library) |
